## Random Code Generator
In this challenge we are meant to create a password generator; using the provided HTML and Style.css by creating the Javascript functionality

First I defined the varibale and set all their boolians as false/empty

After I creat the functions that are responsible for all prompts, 
Then I created a for loop where I placed the selections for some of the prompts

finally, I added the get element that shows the user what the answer is i.e what is happening in the Javascript.
